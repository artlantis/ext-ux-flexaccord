Ext.ux.FlexAccord is a layout manager that allows for dynamically resizing accordion panels in a container. It does also allow for reorganizing panel positions using drag/drop operations, supporting multiple containers that use Ext.ux.FlexAccord.

For an example implementation, see http://www.siteartwork.de/flexaccord/examples/twopanel.html
